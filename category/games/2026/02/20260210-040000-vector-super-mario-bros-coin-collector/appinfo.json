  "description": "Navigate platforms and collect falling coins while avoiding gaps in this simplified Mario-inspired endurance challenge.",
  "rationale": "This game focuses on precise platforming and resource collection, providing a foundational environment for RL agents to learn spatial navigation and timing without the complexity of combat.",
  "details": "The game features a single-screen environment with three floating platforms at different heights. Coins spawn at random intervals at the top of the screen and fall downwards. The player controls a character that can move left, right, and jump. If the player falls off the bottom of the screen (through gaps between platforms), the game ends. The objective is to survive as long as possible while maximizing the coin count. Gravity and basic inertia are applied to the character's movement.",
