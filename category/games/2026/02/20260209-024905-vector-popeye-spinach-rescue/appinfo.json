  "description": "Rescue Olive Oyl while avoiding Brutus and collecting spinach for a power boost.",
  "rationale": "This game implements a multi-tiered platform logic with enemy AI pathfinding and state-based power-up mechanics, making it an excellent environment for reinforcement learning agents to study risk-reward trade-offs.",
  "details": "The game consists of four horizontal platforms connected by ladders. The player (Popeye) starts at the bottom and must collect hearts or musical notes thrown by Olive Oyl from the top floor. Brutus wanders the platforms, moving between levels to intercept Popeye. If Popeye touches Brutus, a life is lost. A spinach can spawn randomly on the map; if Popeye collects it, he enters a temporary 'invincible' state where he can knock Brutus off the screen for bonus points. The game ends when all lives are lost or a target score is reached. Physics includes gravity and ladder-climbing constraints.",
