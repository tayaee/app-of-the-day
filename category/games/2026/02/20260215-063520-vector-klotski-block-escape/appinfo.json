  "description": "Master the classic sliding block puzzle to guide the main red block to freedom.",
  "rationale": "This game focuses on spatial reasoning and pathfinding. It is ideal for training AI agents in long-term planning and state-space search algorithms, as every move counts towards an optimal solution.",
  "details": "The game consists of a 4x5 grid containing various rectangular blocks. One 2x2 block (the King block) must be moved to the bottom-center exit. Other blocks of sizes 1x1, 1x2, and 2x1 act as obstacles. Blocks can only slide into adjacent empty spaces. The game state is represented as a 2D array, and the challenge lies in the limited maneuvering space.",

  "how_to_play": "Click and drag blocks using the mouse or use arrow keys to move the selected block. Each successful move increases the move counter. The score is calculated as 10000 / total_moves upon reaching the exit. Lower moves result in a higher final score.",
