  "description": "A precision-based vertical platformer inspired by Super Mario's classic jump physics.",
  "rationale": "This game focuses on the core mechanic of platformers: jump timing and horizontal control. It is designed for reinforcement learning agents to master momentum and collision detection in a dynamic environment.",
  "details": "The game features a Mario-like character that must jump upwards through a series of procedurally generated platforms. Platforms have varying widths and move horizontally at higher difficulty levels. The gravity and jump velocity are modeled after 8-bit classics. The screen scrolls upward as the player ascends, and falling below the bottom of the screen results in a game over. Power-ups like a 'Super Mushroom' occasionally appear to increase the jump height for a single leap.",
