  "description": "Serve thirsty customers and collect empty mugs in this fast-paced arcade classic.",
  "rationale": "This game focuses on resource management and spatial awareness. It targets casual gamers and provides a structured environment for AI agents to learn multi-tasking and priority-based decision making.",
  "details": "A simplified version of the arcade classic Tapper. The player controls a bartender across four horizontal bars. Customers appear at the left side of each bar and slowly advance toward the right. The player must pour a drink and send it sliding down the bar to push the customer back and eventually make them leave. If a drink reaches the end of the bar without a customer, it breaks. If a customer reaches the right end of the bar, the player loses. Customers also slide empty mugs back toward the right, which the player must catch before they fall.",
