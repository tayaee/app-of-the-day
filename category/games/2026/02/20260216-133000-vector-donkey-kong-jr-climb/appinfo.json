  "description": "Rescue the captured giant by climbing vines and avoiding mechanical traps in this vertical platformer.",
  "rationale": "This game focuses on vertical navigation and multi-tasking logic. It challenges AI agents to coordinate climbing mechanics with obstacle timing, providing a classic arcade experience that tests spatial awareness and precision.",
  "details": "The game consists of a single vertical screen with several hanging vines. The player character (Junior) must climb from the bottom to the top to reach a key. Mechanics include: 1. Climbing: Junior moves faster when holding two vines simultaneously. 2. Gravity: Falling from a high altitude results in a game over. 3. Enemies: Snapjaws move along vines and birds fly horizontally across the screen. 4. Interaction: Junior can drop fruit (collectible) onto enemies below to clear them for bonus points. 5. Goal: Grab the key at the top left/right to unlock the cage.",
