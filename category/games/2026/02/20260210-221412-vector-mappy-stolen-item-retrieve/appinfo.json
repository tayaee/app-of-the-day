  "description": "Navigate a multi-story house to retrieve stolen items while outsmarting feline guards.",
  "rationale": "This game targets developers and AI agents interested in pathfinding, state-based enemy AI, and vertical platforming logic. It provides a structured environment for reinforcement learning where agents must balance risk and reward in a maze-like layout.",
  "details": "The game is a simplified 2D platformer inspired by the classic Mappy. It features a house with 5 floors connected by trampolines. The player controls a police mouse (Mappy). Stolen items (Radio, TV, Safe) are scattered across floors. Cats (Meowkies) roam the floors following a basic pursuit-style AI. Mappy cannot jump but uses trampolines to move between floors. While in the air on a trampoline, Mappy is invulnerable to cats. Doors can be opened to release a wave that pushes cats back. The game ends if a cat touches Mappy while on a floor.",
  "game_rules": {
    "scoring": "Radio: 100 points, TV: 200 points, Safe: 500 points. Clearing all items moves to the next level with increased cat speed.",
    "trampoline_logic": "Consecutive bounces without landing on a floor change the trampoline color. 4th bounce breaks the trampoline, resulting in a game over if no floor is reached.",
    "enemy_ai": "Cats move towards the player's current floor and x-coordinate. They turn around if they hit a wall or a closed door."
