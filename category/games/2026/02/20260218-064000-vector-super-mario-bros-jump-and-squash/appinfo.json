  "description": "Master the art of precision jumping to defeat rhythmic waves of Goombas.",
  "rationale": "This game targets developers and AI agents interested in platformer physics and collision detection. It focuses on the core 'stomp' mechanic of Super Mario Bros, providing a clear reward signal for reinforcement learning through enemy elimination and survival timing.",
  "details": "The game is a single-screen survival platformer. The player controls a character that can move left/right and jump. Enemies (Goombas) spawn from the screen edges and move toward the center at varying speeds. The player must jump on top of enemies to squash them. If an enemy touches the player from the side, the game ends. Gravity and acceleration follow classic 2D platformer constants to ensure a professional feel. The background is a clean, single-color dark grey with white vector platforms to minimize visual noise.",
