The Pygame-based application demonstrates stable runtime behavior with proper game loop execution, physics simulation, and rendering. All core game mechanics are implemented and functional including player movement with platformer-style physics, enemy spawning and AI movement toward player, collision detection for stomping mechanics, score tracking, and game state management. The application can be started using 'uv run main.py' and terminated with ESC key or closing the window."
